Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-CJM version 0.03, released March 15, 2010


Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-CJM is a collection of plugins I've written
for Dist::Zilla.  There isn't actually a @CJM bundle yet, because I'm
still working out how I want to use Dist::Zilla.

I've written some other plugins that are distributed separately,
because they had different prerequisites.  The ones collected here
have fairly simple prerequisites, and I didn't want to have to make
separate distributions for all of them.
